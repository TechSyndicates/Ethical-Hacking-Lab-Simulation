\# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking Lab Simulation — Tech Syndicates



Second Year? No more just theory.



We created our own \*\*ethical hacking lab simulation\*\* using DVWA, rotating through real roles: Setup, Attack, and Reporting. Each round focused on learning real vulnerabilities, launching live attacks, and documenting them like a pro.



\## ⚔️ Project Flow

Each simulation round had 3 rotating teams:

\- \*\*Setup Team\*\*: Deployed DVWA, created the vulnerable environment

\- \*\*Attack Team\*\*: Launched live web attacks and documented payloads

\- \*\*Report Team\*\*: Analyzed the attack and wrote clean, structured PDF reports



\## 🔄 Rounds Completed



| Round | Vulnerabilities                        | Status |

|-------|----------------------------------------|--------|

| 1     | XSS (Reflected \& Stored)              | ✅ Done |

| 2     | SQL Injection, Brute Force            | ✅ Done |

| 3     | File Upload, Command Injection        | ✅ Done |

| 4     | LFI, CSRF (bonus round)               | ✅ Done |



\## 📁 Reports



All reports are inside the `Reports/` folder, round-wise. Includes screenshots, payloads, and explanation of attacks + fixes.
