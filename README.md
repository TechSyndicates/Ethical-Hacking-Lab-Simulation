# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking Lab Simulation — Tech Syndicates

Second Year? No more just theory.

We created our own **ethical hacking lab simulation** using DVWA, rotating through real roles: Setup, Attack, and Reporting. Each round focused on learning real vulnerabilities, launching live attacks, and documenting them like a pro.

---

## ⚔️ Project Flow

Each simulation round had 3 rotating teams:

- **Setup Team**: Deployed DVWA, created the vulnerable environment  
- **Attack Team**: Launched live web attacks and documented payloads  
- **Report Team**: Analyzed the attack and wrote clean, structured PDF reports

## 🔄 Rounds Completed

| Round | Vulnerabilities                  | Status   |
|-------|----------------------------------|----------|
| 1     | XSS (Reflected & Stored)         | ✅ Done  |
| 2     | SQL Injection, Brute Force       | ✅ Done  |
| 3     | File Upload, Command Injection   | ✅ Done  |

## 📁 Reports

All reports are inside the `Reports/` folder, organized round-wise. Includes screenshots, payloads, and explanations of attacks + fixes.

## 🧠 Learnings

- Hands-on web hacking experience (XSS, SQLi, LFI, etc.)
- Team coordination and rotation strategy
- Red/Blue team dynamics
- Building confidence through simulation, not slides
